        <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
        <h3>Pizza Margherita</h3>
        <p>ATTENTION: It is a recipe quickly found on the internet to do the job 
            and it has not been tested in the field + the translation of the various steps was done with google translator, 
            as a Italian I do not recommend following this recipe. 
            It will be updated later with a serious recipe as soon as I have tested more recipes myself.</p>
