        <h2>What is pizza margherita?</h2>
        <p>The pizza Margherita is the typical Neapolitan pizza, topped with tomato, mozzarella (traditionally the fior di latte is used, not that of buffalo), fresh basil, salt and oil; it is, 
        together with pizza marinara, the most popular Italian pizza.
        It certainly represents the symbol par excellence (among the many tastes) of the Italian cultural and culinary heritage, widespread for its fame all over the world and in all its variants.
