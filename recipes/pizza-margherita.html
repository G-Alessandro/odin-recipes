        <h2>What is pizza margherita?</h2>
        <p>The pizza Margherita is the typical Neapolitan pizza, topped with tomato, mozzarella (traditionally the fior di latte is used, not that of buffalo), fresh basil, salt and oil; it is, 
        together with pizza marinara, the most popular Italian pizza.
        It certainly represents the symbol par excellence (among the many tastes) of the Italian cultural and culinary heritage, widespread for its fame all over the world and in all its variants.

        <ol>
            <li>Dilute the yeast in a little warm water, add 50 grams of flour, 
                mix by adding the necessary water, let it rise for 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Arrange the flour on the work surface as if to create a volcano by mixing
                a pinch of salt
            </li>  
            <p></p>         
            <li>In the center, place the prepared yeast and work the mixture with
                 energy by combining the lukewarm water necessary to obtain a soft dough
                  and let it rise until doubled in volume.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Divide the dough into two parts, roll them out a discotheque, 
                line two molds (20-24 cm in diameter) well brushed with oil, 
                cover them with a cloth and let them rise for 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Seasoning</h3>
        <ol>           
            <li>Peel the tomatoes, remove the seeds, cut them into small pieces, 
                drain them in a mesh strainer.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Slice the mozzarella and let it drain.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>The final</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>When the dough in the molds has risen, leaving a centimeter free all around,
                 sprinkle it with the tomatoes, add salt, sprinkle with a little oil and bake in a hot oven at 250 Â° for about 10 minutes. 
                 Remove, distribute the mozzarella, basil leaves, a drizzle of oil on the surface of the pizza and place back in the oven for about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <p></p>
            <li>The pizza is ready when the "cornice" is golden brown.</li>
