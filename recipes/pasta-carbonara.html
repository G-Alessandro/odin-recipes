        <h2 class="info">What is pasta alla carbonara?</h2>

        <p>Pasta alla carbonara is a characteristic dish of Lazio and more particularly of Rome,
             prepared with popular ingredients and with an intense taste. 
            The most traditionally used types of pasta are spaghetti and rigatoni.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h1 class="ingredients">Ingredients for one person</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>80 g of pasta</li>
                <li>2 yolk or whole egg (with the yolk the flavor is more intense)</li>
                <li>30+10 g of pecorino romano and/or parmesan (the pecorino romano is the traditional ingredient and tastes stronger than parmesan, i like both. The 10 g are for the final addition)</li>
                <li>40-50 g of bacon/guanciale (guanciale is the traditional ingredient, 
                    but after years of testing I much prefer bacon, 
                    it tastes better, at least to me)</li>
                <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>salt</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>

            <h1 class="directions">Directions</h1>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the bacon/guanciale into cubes or matches (cubes between 5 and 10 mm on each side,
                     or parallelepipeds with a square base, always between 5 and 10 mm on the side and as high as you like).
                </li>
                    <p></p>
                <li>Put the yolks/egg in a large container, grind the black pepper inside 
                    (keep in mind that we will put the pasta inside, so it must be large enough for it).</li>
                    <p><strong>*If you use the egg yolks, you can freeze the egg whites in ice molds or other containers and then be used for other recipes*
                    </strong></p>
                    <p></p>
                <li>Lightly beat the eggs, then add the 30 g of pecorino romano/parmesan and mix to mix well.
                </li>
                <p><strong>*If it is too solid you have probably added a lot of cheese or the yolks/eggs were small, 
                    do not worry, when you add the pasta there will be a little water with it that will dissolve everything, 
                    or if there was little on the pasta, take it directly from the pot a little at a time*</strong></p>
                <p></p>
                <li>Put the pancetta/guanciale in a non-stick pan and heat over low heat to melt the fat</li>
                <p><strong>*Sometimes the bacon may have little fat, to avoid burning it is better to add a little oil at the beginning*</strong></p>
                <p></p>
                <li>Continue to cook the pancetta/guanciale until it is crispy but not dry and the fat is solid but almost transparent</li>
                <p></p>
                <li>Cook the pasta in plenty of not too salty water</li>
                <p><strong>*The pecorino romano/parmesan are very salty, adding too much salt could ruin the dish*</strong></p>
                <li>Take the pasta with a fork or kitchen tongs, 
                    drain it slightly and place it in the container where you put the yolks/egg, cheese and black pepper.</li>
                <p><strong>*Do not mix the pasta with the pancetta/guanciale before mixing it with the yolks/egg, cheese and black pepper, 
                    otherwise the mix will not stick to the pasta due to the fat in the bacon/guanciale*
                </strong></p>
                <p><strong>*If you used short pasta, use a colander but do not drain it completely 
                    and remember to set aside a little hot water in case you need it*
                </strong></p>
                <li>Stir quickly to let the heat left in both the pasta and the water heat the mix until it becomes a cream</li>
                <p><strong>*If everything is very dry you can add a little water from cooking the pasta*</strong></p>
                <li>Add the bacon/guanciale along with some of its fat</li>
                <p><strong>*personally to make the dish a little lighter I don't put it or I put very little of it, 
                    but if you eat pasta alla carbonara you certainly don't do it to stay on a diet*
                </strong></p>
                <li>Finish mixing well, serve on the plate and add the remaining cheese</li>
            </ol>
