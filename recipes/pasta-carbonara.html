        <h2>What is pasta alla carbonara?</h2>
        <p>Pasta alla carbonara is a characteristic dish of Lazio and more particularly of Rome,

            <h1>Ingredients for one person</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>80 g of pasta</li>
                <li>2 yolk or whole egg (with the yolk the flavor is more intense)</li>
                <li>30+10 (when the dish is finished) of pecorino romano and/or parmesan (the pecorino romano is the traditional ingredient and tastes stronger than parmesan, i like both)</li>
                <li>40-50 g of bacon/guanciale (guanciale is the traditional ingredient, 
                    but after years of testing I much prefer bacon, 
                    it tastes better, at least to me)</li>
                <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <h1>Directions</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the bacon/guanciale into cubes or matches (cubes between 5 and 10 mm on each side,
                     or parallelepipeds with a square base, always between 5 and 10 mm on the side and as high as you like).
                </li>
                    <p></p>
                <li>Put the yolks/egg in a large container, grind the black pepper inside 
                    (keep in mind that we will put the pasta inside, so it must be large enough for it).</li>
                    <p>*If you use the egg yolks, you can freeze the egg whites in ice molds or other containers and then be used for other recipes*
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                <li>Lightly beat the eggs, then add the 30 g of pecorino romano/parmesan and mix to mix well.
                </li>
                <p>*If it is too solid you have probably added a lot of cheese or the yolks/eggs were small, 
                    do not worry, when you add the pasta there will be a little water with it that will dissolve everything*</p>
                <li></li>
            </ol>
